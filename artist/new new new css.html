   <h2> What do you hope to achieve with your Tumblr?</h2> 
        <p>I don’t really know what I want to achieve, because it feels like I’ve already reached my goals. I guess I just want to be a memorable blogger, and not have people forget me after I’m no longer relevant.

Also, I get better at writing and comedy with practice. My posts at first were probably not funny at all, and when I go back and read stories I’d written years ago, I cringe. The more I experience seeing what makes people laugh, and pick up writing strategies, the better I get over time. I hope to get so good at writing that people remember my name.</p>
        <h2>But you go by just your first name. Do you plan to eventually write under your full name?</h2>
        <p>Possibly down the road. I want to receive full credit, but also not meet creeps.</p>
        <h2>What kind of strategies have you come up with?</h2>
        <p>I give my writing a twist by adding something like irony. For example, instead of a post that’s like “that moment when you’re sad” sad cat gif I’d turn to something that’s like making fun of the superiority complex that a lot of Harry Potter fans have by pretending to be one of them but getting the names wrong.

Half the fun of my posts is the response I get from people, so instead of trying to make people laugh at what I say, I try to make people laugh from an entire conversation. The reaction from offended fans makes my posts even funnier, which is something I didn’t discover until much later.

Another way I add dimension is by using sarcasm. I could’ve responded to an Islamophobic anonymous message with a straightforward educational answer, but I decided to use sarcasm to make the response memorable and entertaining, along with educational.

My strategy is just adding things that make my writing stand out; whenever I’m about to answer or post something that’s straightforward or typical, I try to change it up by adding something that makes it less forgettable.</p>
